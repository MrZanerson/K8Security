This setup uses a Kind cluster, which should be straightforward to configure - you need install Kind and to setup a cluster is as simple as: kind create cluster --config kind-cluster.yaml
The objective is to obtain Cluster Admin privileges on Kubernetes.
By exploiting CVE-2021-43815, you should then be able to gain further access to the underlying nodes by deploying a malicious pod that mounts the hostâ€™s root directory.
Refer to Badworker.yaml for details.
